# MCP Installer — TODO

## Pending

- [ ] **Explore Composio integration** — add `[C] Explore Composio` option to the menu for browsing/installing additional MCP connectors via Composio. Security assessment already done (SOC 2 Type II, ISO certified, zero data retention — generally safe for productivity tools). Just needs implementation + decision on which Composio connectors to surface.
